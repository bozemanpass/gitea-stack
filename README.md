Documentation and code related to self-hosting laconic network development and build services.

1. Bootstrap development services for Laconic including source code repository, CI/CD pipeline, package registries.
1. Achieve #1 relying only on the following prerequisites:
    * General purpose computer hardware
    * Popular Linux distributions
    * Base software construction tools: compilers and so on
    * Docker (->Podman?)
    * Internet connectivity
    * Public DNS
    * A set of "seed" git repositories, hosted at an existing Laconic deployment, or GitHub for first-generation seed.
2. Do not require any of the following (although they may be used if desired): 
    * Commercial cloud hosting services
    * Public package registries
    * Public container repositories
    * Closed source software
